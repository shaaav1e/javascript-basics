<!-- Explanation:

    window.addEventListener("mousemove", ...):
       1)  window is indeed a DOM object, but specifically, it represents the entire browser window, not an HTML element like a <div>. 
        It’s a global object that allows you to listen for events occurring on the window (such as resizing, scrolling, or mouse movements).
       2)  addEventListener is a method used to listen for specific events on an element (in this case, window).
        "mousemove" is the event we’re listening for. This event fires whenever the mouse is moved anywhere in the window.
       3) (e) => { left = e.clientX; }:
        This part defines a callback function that gets executed whenever the mousemove event is triggered. The function receives the event object (e) as a parameter, which contains information about the event, like the mouse’s position, the element being interacted with, and more.
        e.clientX represents the horizontal position of the mouse relative to the viewport (the visible area of the browser window). It’s measured from the left side of the window.
        left = e.clientX; assigns this horizontal position to the left variable.



    
       - window is a DOM object that represents the browser's window.
       - mousemove is the event triggered when the mouse moves.
       - e is the event object, which contains information about the event, including the mouse's position.
       - e.clientX gives the horizontal position of the mouse relative to the left edge of the window. -->


       <!--     For the dot: We use dot.style.left because we want the dot to follow the mouse instantly. We need to manually update its position.

    For the outline: We use outline.animate() because we want the outline to follow the mouse slowly with animation. The animate function automatically handles the change in position for us over a duration of time, so we don't need to manually update outline.style.left or outline.style.top.

     Think of it like:

    Dot: You’re putting the dot exactly where the mouse is, right away.
    Outline: You’re asking the outline to move smoothly to follow the mouse. -->
